Marcolina Design | Website for award winning design firm | HTML/CSS | JS | jQuery | GSAP

This site was something I was tasked with finalizing.

It needed to be fully responsive, work cross-browser and cross-platform, the basics.

Beyond this, I had to integrate myself with the previous developers code to finish the project.

It could have been built a lot better in my opinion - some things I noticed are:
1. CSS in JS - this didn't need to happen, and could have been handled with simple class switching
2. JS used for anitmations - Could have been done with keyframes or CSS transitions
3. File was not set up appropriately.. there was a missing body tag?

Reach out and tell me if I'm blowing smoke, here!
